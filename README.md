# Random Forest - Wisdom of a Diverse Crowd

If github in unable to render a Jupyter notebook, copy the link of the notebook and enter into the nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

These notebooks provide an introduction to the Random Forest model. 

- Notebook 1: Random Forest: Motivation


         -- Task 1: Train the optimal Decision Tree classifier.

         -- Task 2: Compare the Optimal Decision Tree with a Random Forest Classifier.


- Notebook 2: Random Forest - Training and Feature Selection


         -- Task 1: Train a Random Forest model optimally by using the bagging method.

         -- Task 2: Perform feature selection using the Random Forest model.


- Notebook 3: Random Forest - Study of Randomness and Extracted Features

In this notebook, we study two bagging-based techniques of increasing randomness in the Random Forst model. Also, we investigate the performance of the Random Forest model trained on extracted features. We perform three tasks on a large and complex classification dataset.

         -- Task 1: Train a Random Forest model by using the bagging method on raw features.

         -- Task 2: Train a Random Forest model by using the Extra-Trees method on raw features.

         -- Task 3: Train a Random Forest model by using the bagging method on extracted features.
