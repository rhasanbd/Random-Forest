    "# Random Forest - Training and Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we perform two tasks.\n",
    "- Task 1: Train a Random Forest model optimally by using the **bagging** method.\n",
    "- Task 2: Perform feature selection usin the Random Forest model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We motivate the bagging method by emphasizing the better generalizability of the Random Forest model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Does the Random Forest Model Improve Generalizability?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest achieves better generalizability by reducing the variance of individual Decision Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce variance, the component trees are all designed to be **randomly different from one another**. This leads to **de-correlation between the individual tree predictions** and, in turn, to improved generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forest randomness also helps achieve high robustness with respect to **noisy data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Randomization Techniques for Training Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomness is injected into the trees during the training phase. Two of the most popular randomness injection techniques are:\n",
    "     - Random training data set sampling  (e.g., bagging) \n",
    "     - Randomized node optimization (RNO)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike bagging, RNO uses use all available training data and controls the randomness by varying the number of parameters for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Randomization Technique: Bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging stands for **bootstrap aggregation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In bootstrapping, we use the same training algorithm for every predictor, but to **train them on different random subsets** of the training set. \n",
    "- When sampling is performed with replacement, this method is called bagging. \n",
    "- When sampling is performed without replacement, it is called pasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cse.unl.edu/~hasan/Pics/Bagging.png\" width=700 height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn implements the bagging method to train the Random Forest model. To induce additional randomness, following techniques are used.\n",
    "\t- Learn from a random subset of features.\n",
    "\t- Learn from random thresholds of each feature (using extremely randomized trees or **Extra-Trees**).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Feature Selecion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model can be used to perform feature selecion. It enables us to detrmine the **relative importance of each feature**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Random Forest measures a feature’s importance by looking at how much the tree nodes that use that feature reduce impurity on average (across all trees in the forest). \n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, it is a **weighted average**, where each node’s weight is equal to the number of training samples that are associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn computes this score automatically for each feature after training, then it scales the results so that the sum of all importances is equal to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can access the result using the $feature\\_importances\\_$ attribute of the model."
